   recompiler makes one, through the shared SPIR-V writer (common/utilities/spirv_emit.h).

   The interface the renderer binds: set 0, binding 0 the vertex program's uniform buffers and binding 1 the fragment
   program's (storage buffers of 32-bit words, laid out as UsseShader.buffers says), bindings 2 to 17 the fragment
   program's textures (combined image samplers, by sampler index). A vertex program's attributes are inputs at the
   locations UsseShader.attribute_location gives; its outputs and a fragment program's inputs meet at fixed locations
   (color0 1, color1 2, fog 3, texcoord0 to 9 4 to 13); a fragment program writes location 0. Push constants (16 bytes,
   the vertex stage's): the viewport's state, UssePush */
