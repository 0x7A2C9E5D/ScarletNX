/* What may follow an A57-profile block of units units (A32 words, or Thumb halfwords when thumb is set) at pc, which
   the block compiler made from count units of code (the guest's little-endian bytes from pc): each direct branch's
   target, and the instruction after the block unless control can't reach it (a branch without link, a write to the
   PC, BKPT, when the last instruction isn't conditional). found gets each, with thumb for its instruction set. A
   successor left out only sends the program through a run-time compile there; one too many costs a block that never
   runs. Ahead-of-time discovery's, the Vita's and a 32-bit Switch game's */
